Creating-an-Interactive-Quiz-with-Javascript
============================================

Make awesome online quizzes and test with HTML5, CSS and a little JavaScript.

First question is what type of quiz/test are you running. You have options

- Where there is only ONE correct answer ("test" senario)
- Where answers give you a point amount, and the result is point level measured ("points" senario)
- Where answers lead one of x labels, i.e. you seem like a Maserati than a Toyota ("label" senario)


In order not to conflict with any other library, I've called my name space "DoubleJetski" you can change to your website like "GitHub" or "Google" for example. The quiz will live in DoubleJetski.Quiz._____
