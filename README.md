Creating-an-Interactive-Quiz-with-Javascript
============================================

Make awesome online quizzes and test with HTML5, CSS and a little JavaScript.


First question is what type of quiz/test are you running. You have options

- Where there is only ONE correct answer ("test" senario)
- Where answers give you a point amount, and the result is point level measured ("points" senario)
- Where answers lead one of x labels, i.e. you seem like a Maserati than a Toyota ("label" senario)
